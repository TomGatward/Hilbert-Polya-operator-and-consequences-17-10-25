## Overview


Prime-anchored Hilbert-Polya approach: Abel-regularized trace, Stieltjes resolvent, and a tau-determinant identity for the Riemann xi-function. 


## Abstract


We develop a single analytic device---the \emph{prime–anchored Hilbert--P\'olya (HP) operator}---and show that, after Fej\'er/Paley--Wiener smoothing, its trace identities produce positive semidefinite quadratic forms with a uniform diagonal floor. This Fej\'er positivity axiom ((AC\(_2\))) drives many results of the paper.

Shrinking frequency bands to a fixed prime $p$ transfers the global PSD form to per--prime Hermitian Toeplitz blocks. Their Carath\'eodory/Herglotz generating series are \emph{rational} by the Euler product; hence all poles lie on $|z|=1$, yielding temperedness at every unramified $p$. Moreover, the band rank saturates to the number of distinct Satake parameters, so the Satake multiset is recovered from a single band.

On the global axis, the HP calculus furnishes a right--half--plane Herglotz--Stieltjes identity
\[
\frac{d}{ds}\log\widetilde\Xi(s)=2s\!\int_{(0,\infty)}\frac{d\mu(\lambda)}{\lambda^2+s^2}\,d\lambda+A'(s)\qquad(\Re s>0),
\]
with a positive Stieltjes transform and a holomorphic archimedean package. Positivity precludes zeros in $\Re s>0$ for the centralized completion, and an \emph{archimedean inverse} shows that $A'(s)$ must be a finite digamma mixture, i.e. the standard $\Gamma$--package with uniquely determined parameters.

Prime--localized twists, obtained by globalizing unitary characters ramified only at $p$, isolate $\frac{d}{ds}\log\gamma(s,\pi_p\otimes\chi_p,\psi_p)$ on the RHP; varying the conductor and normalizing at the center recovers the full local $\gamma$--package and hence $\pi_p$ by the local converse. Packaging these identities yields a positivity--based converse theorem: the HP--Fej\'er class coincides with the (extended) Selberg class, forcing the functional equation, $\Gamma$--factor, and Euler product.

Conceptually, Fej\'er positivity removes the circle--method parity barrier by turning the spectral piece into a sum of squares with a diagonal floor; on the geometric side, the identity orbital functorially produces the Hardy--Littlewood singular series, while non-identity orbitals play the minor arcs. As an arithmetic application on $\GL_2$, central Fej\'er bands realize the N\'eron--Tate projector, local idempotents select Bloch--Kato conditions, and the resulting operator inequalities give $\dim_{\Q_p}\Sel_p(E)=\mathrm{rank}\,E(\Q)$, finiteness of $\Sha(E)[p^\infty]$, and, after assembling periods and Tamagawa factors, the full BSD formula. No new estimates are introduced: all conclusions flow from the HP operator’s Fej\'er–induced positivity.
